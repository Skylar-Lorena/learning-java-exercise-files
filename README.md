## Description

```bash

Java is one of the top five programming languages, and is used for websites, embedded controllers, and Android app development. Interested in learning how to code with Java? 
Courtesy of LinkedInLearning instructor, Kathryn Hodge, join me as I cover all the basics: Data types, strings, functions, and loops. Control the flow and logic of your code, and debug your project to make sure it runs perfectly. Along the way, she provides real-world examples and introduces challenges that allow you to practice your new skills. 
This course is perfect for developers who need to get up to speed with Java fast, as well as for beginning programmers who want their first taste of this popular language.
